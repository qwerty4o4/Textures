# TEXTURES
These are the textures I use in my Minecraft videos.

It is a combination of these textures:


- [qwerty's Custom Totem](https://r2beeaton.com/t/)
- [Stare's Trustworthy Stews](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/stare-s-trustworthy-stew/)[^1]
- [Techno Pig](https://phoenixsc.me/download-links/technoblade-pig-1-19/)[^1]
- [Jeb Screams "NOOO"](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/jeb-scream-as-the-death-sound/)
- [1.19 Panorama with Shaders](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/1-19-panorama-with-shaders/)
- [Snowier Snow](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/snowier-snow)[^1][^2]
- [Vanilla Tweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/resource-packs/)


For "Snowier Snow" I use the "Vanilla Short" option, and you can put the full resource pack into the VanillaTweaks website to see what tweaks I use.

Compiled together using [this pack combiner](https://nerawoowty.github.io/packcombiner.html) by [Nerawoowty](https://github.com/nerawoowty)!

Additionally, I will sometimes use [Redstone Tweaks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/redstone-tweaks) as well. This is not included in the pack, but I highly reccommend checking it out, as it is so incredibly helpful when making redstone contraptions.
